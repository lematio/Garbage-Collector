# A C++ Garbage Collector
## Abstract
The objectives of this project are to practice working with pointers and references, and to understand why smart pointers are valued in C++. This is a completion of the [Garbage Collector Project](https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Garbage-Collector). This project involves building a C++ garbage collector.

## Environment
The project development was completed on Bento/Ubuntu 19.04 with the `build-essential` package, which included the GCC 8.3.0 (Ubuntu 8.3.0-6ubuntu1) compiler. This compiler was employed to compile the C++ code.

## Execution
This project includes an executable bash script file for compiling the project with GCC. The commands to compile and run the project tests in bash are respectively as follows:

``` shell
$ ./make
$ ./testPointer
$ ./testLinkedList
```
